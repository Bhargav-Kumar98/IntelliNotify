## Setup Instructions

To set up IntelliNotify, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/intellinotify.git
   cd intellinotify
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create the `.env` File**:
   Add your credentials to a `.env` file as follows:
   ```env
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_token
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   ```

4. **Create the `user_data.json` File**:
   Include user ID and preferences in the `user_data.json` file:
   ```json

   {
        "_id": 8901234567890123456,

                "preferences": [
                    "Notify me about AI and machine learning discussions.",
                    "Let me know if someone shares interesting programming tutorials.",
                    "Alert me if any tech events are being organized."
                ]
            },

        "servers": [
            {
                "server_name": "Travel Buffs",
                "preferences": [
                    "Let me know if someone shares unique travel destinations.",
                    "Notify me about group travel opportunities.",
                    "Alert me about travel discounts or promotions."
                ]

## Commands

### User Commands

- `!ping`: Check if the bot is online and responsive.
- `!add_preference <preference>`: Add a preference to filter messages.
- `!remove_preference <preference>`: Remove a specific preference.
- `!view_preferences`: View your current message preferences.
- `!reset_preferences`: Clear all preferences for the current server.

### Admin Commands

- `!authorize_user <user_id>`: Grant a user access to the bot.
- `!deauthorize_user <user_id>`: Revoke a user's access.
- `!view_authorized_users`: List all users authorized to use the bot.

## How It Works

1. **User Authorization**:
   - When the bot starts, it checks MongoDB for authorized users.
   - The bot owner is automatically authorized if no other users are set.

2. **Message Monitoring**:
   - Continuously scans and processes messages in connected servers.
   - Utilizes LangChain and Groq APIs to evaluate if messages match user preferences.

3. **Real-Time Notifications**:
   - Sends immediate alerts to users when relevant messages are found.
   - Notifications are customized to match user-specific preferences.

4. **Preference Management**:
   - Users can easily add, remove, view, or reset preferences via simple commands.
   - All preferences are securely stored and synced with MongoDB for persistence.
